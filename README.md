I performed computational text analysis and LDA topic modelling on opinion editorials and transcripts of speeches / interviews by right-wing leaders. Specifically, I studied the election of Donald Trump, Brexit and the surprise victory of Scott Morrison's conservative government in Australia’s federal election. I am interested in summarising the narratives that right-wing leaders construct to shore up audience support. This project was submitted for credit for UC Berkeley's DIGHUM101 Practicing the Digital Humanities and scored A.

[Project 2](www.google.com)<br></a>
In this Kaggle competition organised by Jane Street, I developed a trading model to identify arbitrage opportunities to "buy low and sell high". I used XGBoost to build a classifier that decides whether to execute a trade or pass on it. The hyperparameters of the classifier are tuned using Optuna and the model achieved an accuracy score of almost 70%.

[Project 3](www.kaggle.com)<br></a>
The training set used for this project comprises 42,000 images from the MNIST dataset - the de facto "hello world" dataset of computer vision. The goal of this Kaggle competition is to build a deep learning model to recognize handwritten digits (0-9). To achieve this objective, I built a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras.

### default .md from github
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/samuel-lwl/samuel-lwl.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.



### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/samuel-lwl/samuel-lwl.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
